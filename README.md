## Wait, what?

Cali is an AI agent that helps you build React Native apps. It takes all the utilities and functions of a React Native CLI and exposes them as tools to an LLM.

Thanks to that, an LLM can help you with your React Native app development, without the need to remember commands, spending time troubleshooting errors, and in the future, much more.

Under the hood, it uses [Vercel AI SDK](https://github.com/ai-sdk/ai) and [@react-native-community/cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## Features

[TBD]

## Future requests

I like the idea of an AI agent for building React Native apps. I would like to play around with this idea in public, and see where it goes.

Feel free to open an issue or a discussion to suggest ideas or report bugs. Happy to hear from you! ðŸ‘‹
